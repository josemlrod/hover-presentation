            Welcome everyone, thank you for this opportunity. Today I'll be
            walking you through a project I built called "Create Your Own Ad" -
            an interactive demo flow that allowed Transmit's website visitors to
            experience their video ad technology firsthand. This was a strategic
            initiative to drive conversions from visitors to users by letting
            them get hands-on with the product.

            Transmit.live is a streaming monetization technology company. They
            specialize in non-interruptive ad formats - instead of cutting to
            commercial breaks, their ads appear alongside or over content. Think
            picture-in-picture ads during live sports, or overlay banners that
            don't pause the stream.
            <br />
            Their technology is used by major streaming platforms.
            <br />
            The challenge was that most users were onboarded through sales reps,
            and they needed a way for website visitors to understand and
            experience the technology directly.

          <h2>The <span class="text-accent">Challenge</span></h2>
          <div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
            <div

                <li>Sales rep dependency for onboarding</li>
                <li>Static content insufficient for value demo</li>
                <li>Need to showcase technology interactively</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div
              class="flex flex-col items-start gap-2 bg-surfaceElevated px-8 py-6 rounded-lg"

              <h3>The Gap</h3>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  How do you let visitors experience video ad technology without
                  a sales demo?
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>
          <aside class="notes">
            The problem was clear: Transmit had built this solution for
            non-interruptive video ads, but potential users couldn't really
            understand the value just from static content on the website.
            <br />
            They were competing in a crowded market, but their differentiator
            was flexibility - they could implement custom ad formats based on
            client needs.
            <br />
            The challenge was communicating this through the website and letting
            visitors actually experience what they were selling, rather than
            just reading about it.

              The architecture was designed for both user experience and
              scalability.
              <br />
              On the frontend, we used the nested routes approach because it
              allowed us to do the following:
              <br />
              - Keep the flow simple and easy to understand
              <br />
              - Keep the validation of each step separated
              <br />
              - Keep the layout of the flow consistent
              <br />
              The parent layout route held the context for all the user choices
              on each step. This enabled us to also grant/refuse access to next
              steps, and prompt the user to confirm before navigating away since
              their choices could be lost.
              <br />
              The child routes (steps) were responsible for rendering the
              form/content, enforcing requirements from their previous/next step
              to prevent user errors, and validating user input.

              - Updating the `jobProcessing` record in the database.
              <br />
              We're storing the `jobProcessing` record in a Non-relational DB to
              track the encoding progress.
              <br />
              Something we didn't metion before, but should now is that the last
              step in the flow, after submitting the encode it starts polling to
              get the status of the job until the job is completed. That allows
              us to provide the user with some feedback on the status of the
              job.

                    Users uploading large video files could experience long wait

              The first major challenge was keeping users engaged during file
              uploads. Large video files could take minutes to upload, and we
              were worried about drop-offs. Our solution was multi-pronged: we
              set reasonable file size limits, provided high-quality default
              videos so users could experience the flow immediately, and
              implemented direct S3 uploads to avoid bottlenecking through our
              servers. We also added clear progress indicators. The key insight
              was that users who just wanted to test the technology could use
              defaults, while serious prospects would be willing to wait for
              their own content.

              The second challenge was handling the video processing reliably at
              scale. Video encoding with FFmpeg is CPU-intensive and
              time-consuming - downloading files, processing video, uploading
              results, and sending emails could take several minutes per job. We
              couldn't do this synchronously without terrible user experience.
              The solution was a robust async architecture: when users
              submitted, we immediately queued the job and gave them
              confirmation. Lambda workers would pick up jobs as capacity
              allowed, process them completely, and send results via email. We
              monitored the ratio of submissions to completions to ensure 100%
              reliability.
